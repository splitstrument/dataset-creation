# data-organizer
This tool is used to move all files from different datasets to a single uniform data structure.

Stems will be grouped into folders for different instruments. Check the `mapping.yaml` file in the `data-statistics`
tool for an overview on what instrument groups exist. At this point in time many instruments are simply grouped into an
folder called `other`.

Note that any pre-mixed track will be moved into an instrument folder called `mix`.

## Example folder structure
```
root
+-- track1
|   +-- instrument1
|       +-- stem1.flac
|       +-- stem3.flac
|   +-- instrument2
|       +-- stem2.flac
|       +-- stem4.flac
|   +-- mix
|       +-- mix.flac
+-- track2
|   +-- instrument3
|       +-- stem1.wav
|   +-- instrument4
|       +-- stem2.wav
|       +-- stem4.wav
|   +-- mix
|       +-- mix.wav
```
